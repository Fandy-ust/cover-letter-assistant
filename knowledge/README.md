# Knowledge

The central memory for your writing style.

## How you use it
You can manually edit these files if you want to explicitly add or remove rules about how your cover letters should be written. 

## How the agents use it
- `writing_strategies.md` (Hard Memory): Generated by the **Style Extractor** and updated by the **Style Updater**. Contains confirmed rules about tone, vocabulary, and formatting. The **Cover Letter Writer** reads this to mimic your style.
- `style_notes.md` (Soft Memory): Updated by the **Style Updater** during drafting sessions to capture tentative observations or user feedback that might later become a hard rule.

# Job Descriptions

Drop the raw job postings here.

## How you use it
Save the text or details of a job posting you want to apply for in this folder. You can use `.pdf`, `.txt`, or `.md` files (`.md` preferred).

If something is missing from the posting, create a new `.md` file with extra notes (for recruiter messages, referral context, or role-specific constraints).

## How the agents use it
The **Job Researcher** skill reads the files placed here (or text you paste into chat) to extract role details, research the company, and generate the enriched `workspace/job_description.md`.

# Reference Drafts

Drop your past cover letters and writing samples here.

## How you use it
Place any past cover letters or documents that reflect your preferred writing style in this folder. Supported formats: `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.md` (`.md` preferred).

You can freely add `.md` notes describing style preferences that may not appear in old letters (for example: "shorter openings" or "avoid buzzwords").

## How the agents use it
The **Voice Archivist** skill batch-analyzes the files here to understand your tone, vocabulary, and structure preferences, and then updates `memory/style_guidelines.md`.

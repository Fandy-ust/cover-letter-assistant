# Job Descriptions

Drop the raw job postings here.

## How you use it
Save the text or details of a job posting you want to apply for in this folder. You can use `.pdf`, `.txt`, or `.md` files (`.md` preferred).

If something is missing from the posting, create a new `.md` file with extra notes (for recruiter messages, referral context, or role-specific constraints).

## How the agents use it
The **Job Researcher** skill accepts both files in this folder and direct chat input (pasted text, screenshot, or URL). It extracts role details, researches the company, and generates the enriched `active_application/job_description.md`.

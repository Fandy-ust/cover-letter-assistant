# Personal Materials

Drop your raw career materials here.

## How you use it
Place your CV, resume, LinkedIn export, or any background document in `raw_inputs/profile/`. Supported formats: `.pdf`, `.txt`, `.md` (preferred).

You can also create extra `.md` notes here any time (for achievements, project details, metrics, or talking points you want the agent to use).

## How the agents use it
The **Profile Builder** skill reads the files you place here to extract your professional background and generate/update your `memory/personal_profile.md`. 

You can also provide the same context directly in chat if that is easier for your workflow.

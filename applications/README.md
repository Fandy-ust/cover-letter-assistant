# Saved Applications

The archive of your past and in-progress job applications.

## How you use it
You don't need to manually manage this folder. Use the Cursor Agent to switch between applications or start a new one.

## How the agents use it
The **Workspace Switcher** skill saves your `active_application/` files into a subfolder here when you switch to another application. When you resume an application, it copies the files back into the `active_application/` folder.

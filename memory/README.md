# Knowledge

The central memory for your writing style.

## How you use it
You can manually edit these files if you want to explicitly add or remove rules about how your cover letters should be written. 

## How the agents use it
- `my_info/personal_profile.md` (Profile memory): Read by the **Application Advisor** and used as core source context by the **Profile Builder** when maintaining your profile.
- `style_guidelines.md` (Style baseline): Generated by the **Voice Archivist** from reference drafts (including optionally from previous applications). Captures your consistent voice, structure, and phrasing patterns.
- `writing_strategies.md` (Hard Memory): Updated by the **Writing Coach**. Contains confirmed, explicit rules about tone, vocabulary, and formatting. The **Cover Letter Writer** applies these strictly.

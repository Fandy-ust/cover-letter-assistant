# Workspace

The active working area for your current job application.

## How you use it
You generally don't need to manually edit files here unless you want to make direct tweaks. Instead, you interact with the agents to build and refine the files in this folder.

## How the agents use it
- `job_description.md` is created by the **Job Researcher**.
- `application_brief.md` is generated by the **Application Advisor**.
- `final_draft.md` is drafted and iteratively refined by the **Cover Letter Writer**.

When you switch to a different application, the **Workspace Switcher** saves the contents of this folder into the `applications/` directory and loads the next one here.
